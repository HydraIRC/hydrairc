HydraIRC Developer Notes
========================

     IMPORTANT *** Read LICENSE.TXT first! *** IMPORTANT


HydraIRC is written using Visual Studio .NET 2003.
The code has been ported to Visual Studio .NET 2005 and support for Visual Studio .NET 2003
has been dropped.

Visual Studio.NET 2005 including Service Pack 1 is REQUIRED to build HydraIRC.
(due to changes in atlrx.h, failure to compile with SP1 will result access violations
occuring in the regular expression matcher)

If you want to start helping out, check out the TODO.TXT and try and fix some bugs,
then start with some of the simpler things until you're used to the codebase.

SVN Access
==========

DO NOT COMMIT CHANGES TO THE SVN TREE.

Currently there is registered developer read and write access, but this write
access will be removed in the near future.

To get your changes included, see "Submitting Patches" below.

Compiling
=========

Make sure you have a copy of the SVN tree, as well as the following files:

HydraIRC-libxml2-20021126.zip
WTL 8 - http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=109071

HydraIRC is written and developed using Visual Studio .NET 2003 and this is the
only supported build environment.  If you're using something else then you're on
your own.

-----------------------------------

VISUAL STUDIO 2008 NOTES: 

Visual Studio 2008 and forward NO LONGER REQUIRE #define vsnprintf _vsnprintf. You must comment this out of libxml2's win32config.h for the included (2.4.24) version listed below for the build to succeed.

The ATL Server package has become almost impossible to find as a regular download, but it can now be obtained at https://github.com/gabegundy/atlserver

You will need this in addition to the below mentioned WTL 8.0 files (Add them to your global includes for ease of use) in order to compile on VS 2008 or newer. Add the WTL 8 and ATL Server include directories to global include paths. 

With the above #define removal and using the 2002-11-26 version of libxml2 Hydra builds cleanly on VS 2008 Professional with only warnings about deprecated/unsafe APIs in LibXML2 (which should be resolved by updating to a newer version, which is a work in progress). All other parts of the system build cleanly without warnings - except one.

Line #532 in Plugin_WinAMP/Plugin.cpp throws a C4067 warning in VS 2008 - "unexpected tokens following preprocessor directive - expected a newline" - this is due to the '.' included in the #ifdef - #ifdef HYDRAIRC_0.3.163 throws the warning, but #ifdef HYDRAIRC_03163 does not. This code could be safely removed, as we are not targeting on building the plugin with downlevel versions anymore. 

-----------------------------------

If you are using Visual Studio .NET 2003/2002/2005 you will also need to do the following:

 - Unzip HydraIRC-libxml2-20021126.zip to HydraIRC/libs/libxml2
 - extract it anywhere you like. e.g. "D:\My Documents\Source\Libs\wtl\8.0"
 - Install the WTL application wizard (from the wtl folder)
  - If you are using VS.NET 2005 then run AppWiz\setup80.js
  - If you are using VS.NET 2003 then run AppWiz\setup71.js
  - If you are using VS.NET 2002 then run AppWiz\setup70.js
 - Start up VC.net and adjust your VC project include directories
 - so that the directory you unzipped wtl75_4196.zip to appears first.
 - From the VS 2005 menus, select: tools/options, then expand projects & solutions/VC++ Directories
   then select "Include Files" from the "Show directories for" dropdown
 - From the VS 2003/2002 menus, select: tools/options/projects/VC++ Directories/Show directories for "Include Files" 
 - Add the wtl 8 "include" folder to the top of list
   e.g. "D:\My Documents\Source\Libs\wtl\8.0\include"   
 - next add the folder "HydraIRC\include\altered_wtl_includes\8.0" to the top of the list (before the new wtl entry)
 - next add the folder "HydraIRC\include\altered_ms_includes" to the top of the list (before the new altered_wtl_includes entry)


If you are using Visual Studio .NET 2002 you will also need to do the following:
[note, this section was not written by Hydra and has not been verified or updated for 0.3.138 or higher]
[If you have any problems with the VS.NET 2002 instructions please ask johnp for help in #hydrairc]

 - Open up HydraIRC/HydraIRC.vcproj with a text editor and change the 4th line of the file
   from Version="7.10" to Version="7.0"
 - Open up HydraIRC/libs/libxml2/win32/dsp/libxml2.vcproj and change the version to Version="7.0" again.
 - Open up HydraIRC/HydraIRCPlugin/HydraIRCPlugin.vcproj and do the same yet again.
 - Start Visual Studio and open HydraIRC.vcproj
 - Add the libxml2.vcproj file as an existing project to the HydraIRC solution and build it.
 - Add the HydraIRCPlugin.vcproj file as an existing project to the HydraIRC solution and build it.
 - In the solution explorer, right-click on the HydraIRC project and click 'Project Dependencies...'
 - Make sure that HydraIRC depends on libxml2 and HydraIRCPlugin and that HydraIRCPlugin depends on libxml2
 - Click the Project Build Order tab and make sure the build order is:
 	libxml2
 	HydraIRCPlugin
 	HydraIRC
 - All done.  You can now happily build the solution from scratch.
 
Submitting Patches
==================

I will only accept source code updates in the form of patches. 

You can use TortoiseSVN or a win32 port of the unix "diff" tool (it's also part
of cygwin).

I *ONLY* accept patches created by TortoiseSVN or patches in the "UNIFIED DIFF" 
format (the -u option of diff)

To create a patch with TortoiseSVN right-click on a file or folder somewhere
in your SVN checkout and select "TortoiseSVN / Create patch ..." from the
context menu.  Make sure you select ALL the files that have been modified that make
your patch work.

When creating patches using diff, use a command similar to this:

"diff -bua oldfile newfile >../patches/mypatch.diff"
or 

"diff -buar olddirectory newdirectory >../patches/mypatch.diff"

add -N if you've added new source code files.   

Please make sure the patch applies before sending it.
(i.e. Get a fresh copy of the CVS tree and apply your patch to it)

Here's how you might apply the patch..

"patch -p 1 < ../patches/mypatch.diff"

once you've created a diff, e-mail it to "diffs AT hydrairc DOT com" 

Please tell me your IRC nick when submitting patches in the e-mail and also
let me know what the patch does too!

You can also dcc it to me on EFNet too. 

Working on the source
=====================

NOTE: this section is very out of date, you're probably best just working out
of your fresh checkout and creating patches from there.  Familiarise yourself
with the following SVN commands: update, status, revert and diff
TortoiseSVN is very good at letting you compare revisions of code and
creating/merging code.  Look for a guide and read it!


1) check out svn tree on 1/1/2004, save entire tree in folder SVN-2004-01-01 and zip up the folder as SVN-2004-01-01.zip
2) copy that folder and save as SVN-2004-01-01-WorkingCopy
3) make yor changes to SVN-2004-01-01-WorkingCopy
4) run "diff -buarN SVN-2004-01-01 SVN-2004-01-01-WorkingCopy > patch.diff" to create a patch.
5) checkout current SVN, on 12/2/2004, save into folder SVN-2004-02-12 and zip up the folder as SVN-2004-02-12.zip
6) in SVN-2004-02-12, run the command patch -p 1 --dry-run < patch.diff
6a) if it can't find the files experiment with the the -p option,eg. patch -p 1 --dry-run < patch.diff
6b) if there are no errors, run the patch again, but without the --dry-run option.
6c) if you have sections that don't apply, try the -l option, or manually patch in the un-applied patches from the "<sourcefile>.reject" files that patch creates.
7) When all you modifications have been patched into the current source tree, make sure your changes still work and then create a NEW patch as follows.
8) rename SVN-2004-02-12 to SVN-2004-02-12-WorkingCopy
9) unzip SVN-2004-02-12.zip so you have SVN-2004-02-12 and SVN-2004-02-12-WorkingCopy
10) create a diff between SVN-2004-02-12 and SVN-2004-02-12-WorkingCopy
11) send latest patch to the mailing list with notes on what it does.

Note:  it's helpful to CLEAN your working copies before making diffs, also, exclude the following files from your diff:

.svn
*.vcproj
*.sln
*.suo
BuildLog.htm
*.obj
*.pch
*.lib
*.ncb
*.map
*.pdb
*.idb
*.orig
*.rej
Debug
Release

You save that list as a text file, then use this with diff's -X option.  e.g. "diff -buarN -X excludelist.txt SVN-2004-01-01 SVN-2004-01-01-WorkingCopy > patch.diff"

Coding Style
============

Follow my coding style:

variable names "AreLikeThis"
global variables "g_AreLikeThis"
member variables "m_AreLikeThis"
struct's "AreLikeThis_s"
typedef's to struct's "AreLikeThis_t"
#defines ARE_LIKE_THIS
class names sould be "CLikeThis" but not all of them are, all new classes should be C-prefixed.
I use "i" for general loops and "pass" for some loops that have nested general loops.

{'s and }'s generally go on seperate lines
if there's only one line of code after an if statement, you
can decide wether to use {}'s yourself, but the rule is:
Make It Readable.

Some things I don't do for readability's sake, e.g.

void *MyPtr;
if (MyPtr = MyFunction())
  ...
  
would be written as:

void *MyPtr;
Myptr = MyFunction();
if (MyPtr)
  ...

You will probably see other examples where code could be slightly
optimized (in terms of cpu instructions) but isn't, for the sake of
readability and future maintenance.

Note: some code needs to be updated to conform to my current style.

Doxygen
=======

There are doxygen docs on the website

http://hydrairc.sourceforge.net/doxygen/

In the Doxygen folder you'll find a project file which you can use to
generate your own doxygen docs on your machine, but you'll need to
install doxygen and adjust the absolute paths.

Tabs
====

Set your editor to replace tabs with spaces, set the tab-size
to 2 characters.

Other Notes
===========

More notes as and when I think of anything useful to tell you.
