2. Text Attributes

The primary task of an IRC Client program is to display text to the
user, and allow text messages to be sent to other users. As such, there
is a need for the ability to change the format of this text (for example,
to cause a certain word or phrase to appear in boldface) -- these changes
in text format will hereafter be known as "text attributes". It is up to
each client to determine which (if any) requests for an attribute change
to permit.

Text attributes are valid in at least the following areas:
* in the body of a PRIVMSG or NOTICE
* in the text of a DCC CHAT connection
* user-displayed text inside a CTCP (such as ACTION)
* in a channel's topic
* in the "comment" (text displayed to users) portion of any IRC command
  (such as KICK)

All attributes are cumulative, that is to say, no specific attribute
overrides any other attribute type. All attribute requests may be
ignored, and any particular combination of attributes may be ignored,
either by design or by user request. Certain combinations may not make
sense in all environments; therefore there is no requirement that all
possible combinations be implemented by any client.

Attributes are reset to client defaults at the receipt of any CR (ASCII
13) and/or LF (ASCII 10).  Thus attribute changes only have a lifetime
of one line of text.

All attribute changes are preceded and followed by the format character,
ASCII character 6 (control-F, hereafter referred to as <^F>).  Only one
attribute change may be encoded within each pair of format characters.
This encoding allows IRC client programs to easily detect and ignore any
attribute changes they don't wish to implement.  It also allows attributes
to have optional arguments, and allows for the possible expansion of
arguments in future revisions of CTCP.

The first character (octet) of an attribute change is the name of the
attribute, which is case-sensitive.  Any following characters determine
what changes are to be made.  There is no whitespace between the format
character and the attribute, between the attribute and its arguments, or
between the arguments and the closing format character.  Therefore, the
format of an attribute change is:

<^F> <attribute> [optional-args...] <^F>

Here follows a list of the attributes and what effect they are intended
to have.


2.1 Bold

Specification: <^F> "B" ["+"|"-"] <^F>

The bold attribute turns on or off "bold text".  Clients may display
this by using the "bold" attribute of the current font, or by choosing
a predefined color combination, based on the capabilities of the terminal
being used.

A "+" turns on bold mode; "-" turns it off.  If no "+" or "-" follows,
a "+" should be assumed -- that is, the default action is to turn the
attribute on.

If the bold attribute is turned "on" multiple times, the client should
leave bold mode on until the attribute has been turned "off" an equal
number of times.  (Each "B-" turns off exactly one previous "B+" request.)
Extra "off" ("B-") requests should be ignored.  This behavior holds for
all of the on/off attributes: bold, reverse, underline, overstrike,
italics, URL, and blink.


2.2 Inverse (Reverse)

Specification: <^F> "V" ["+"|"-"] <^F>

The inverse attribute should reverse the foreground and background colors
currently in use.  If this behavior is not readily available to the client,
due to terminal type restrictions, user-defined colors may be used to
indicate this state.  The "+" and "-" behave as described in 2.1.


2.3 Underline

Specification: <^F> "U" ["+"|"-"] <^F>

This attribute should turn on and off the "underline" attribute of the
current font.  It may be displayed using predefined color combinations
if the terminal lacks underline capabilities.  The "+" and "-" behave
as described in 2.1.


2.4 Overstrike

Specification: <^F> "S" ["+"|"-"] <^F>

The overstrike attribute is typically a solid horizontal line through
the middle of text.  It may also be displayed using predefined color
combinations if the terminal lacks overstrike capabilities.  The "+"
and "-" behave as described in 2.1.


2.5 Italics

Specification: <^F> "I" ["+"|"-"] <^F>

This attribute turns on or off the "italics" attribute of the current
font, typically causing text to be displayed at a slant.  It may also
be displayed using predefined color combinations if the terminal lacks
overstrike capabilities.  The "+" and "-" behave as described in 2.1.


2.6 Colours

Specification: <^F> "C" [foreground-color [background-color]] <^F>

This allows the requestor to specify the desired colours in which the
text following this attribute will be displayed.  This attribute is
cumulative as well, within the restrictions of the terminal in use.
Colours may be chosen in two methods, either from an indexed colour
table, or by specifying an RGB value.

Indexed colors are indicated with a single hexidecimal digit, from the
range "0".."9" inclusive, or "A".."F" inclusive, which map to RGB colors
as per Appendix A.  The index color is case-sensitive; characters "a"
through "f" are reserved for possible future use.

RGB colors are indicated with a "#" followed by six hexidecimal digits. 
Each pair of digits represents a single 8-bit value, making up three
8-bit values in total. These values indicate the intensities of red,
green, and blue, respectively.  The hexidecimal digits "A".."F" are
case-sensitive.  Therefore the format of an RGB color specification is:

"#" <2-digit-hexidecimal-RED-value> <2-digit-hexidecimal-GREEN-value>
<2-digit-hexidecimal-BLUE-value>

For example, one possible RGB color specification for grey is:

"#CCCCCC"

In addition to indexed and RGB colors, the following special characters
are defined:

"-"
A dash indicates that the color should remain unchanged.  This is
intended to be a place holder.  For example, to change only the
background color, a color-change attribute would be specified with the
foreground color as "-".

"."
A dot indicates that the color should be returned to the default colors
of the client.  A client's default colors are never guaranteed to be any
value, and may possibly have been set by the user.

The background color of a color-change attribute may be omitted, in
which case it is equivalent to "-" (the background color is left
unchanged).

The foreground AND background colors may BOTH be omitted, in which case
they are both equivalent to "." and the foreground and background colors
are reset to the default values for the client.

Some example color-change attributes:

"CF"
The foreground color is changed to index-value "F" (white) while leaving
the background color unchanged.

"C#FFBBBB0"
The foreground color is changed to RGB value "FFBBBB" (which will
probably be some shade of pink), and the background color is changed to
index-value "0" (black).

"C#FFBBBB#000000"
This has the same effect as the previous change.

"C"
The foreground and background colors are reset to the client's default
colors.

Some clients may wish to ignore color changes within certain ranges. 
This is valid. For example, a client may choose to ignore color changes
that cause the foreground and background colors to be too similar.  One
possible means of comparison would be:
            R1 < R2 - 8 or R1 > R2 + 8
            G1 < G2 - 8 or G1 > G2 + 8
            B1 < B2 - 8 or B1 > B2 + 8
(where R1 is the red component of color 1, G1 is the green component, and
B1 is the blue component; likewise R2, G2, and B2 are the red, green, and
blue components of color 2, respectively)

If a pair of colours passes these 3 tests, then it should be considered
different enough for display purposes, based on constraints of the
current display screen. The choice of a range of 16 values is arbitrary
for the example, and individual clients could of course choose larger
or smaller values at their discretion. 

CTCP format color changes are independent of the ANSI color-code standard.
CTCP color changes may be made interchangably with ANSI color changes if
the IRC client supports it.  However, the results are largely undefined,
since ANSI supports a much smaller color set, and has rules about when
terminal settings will be reset.


2.7 Size

Specification: <^F> "F" ["+"|"-" [number]] <^F>

Choice of typeface point sizes is expected to vary wildly between IRC
clients on different machines and architectures; therefore specifying an
exact point size for text display would be meaningless.  Instead, a
method of asking for a change relative to the default size is given.

A "+" indicates an increase in text size (ie, larger text), and a "-"
indicates a decrease (ie, smaller text).  A number following the "+" or
"-" specifies how much to grow or shrink the text size.  The number is
not restricted to a single digit.  If no number follows, a "1" is assumed.

Clients may (and are expected to) enforce a limit on the allowed
variation of text sizes.  For example, a client may refuse to let text
grow beyond 4 units larger or smaller than the default.  Each unit
should approximate a growth/shrinkage of about 10%.  (An increase of
font size by 10 units, if allowed, should cause the font size to
approximately double.)

If a size attribute is given with no "+" or "-", it is a request to
return the text to the default size.


2.8 Uniform Resource Locator

Specification: <^F> "L" ["+"|"-"] <^F>

IRC clients may wish to highlight or otherwise process Uniform Resource
Locators (URLs) in messages.  This attribute turns on or off "URL mode";
text which arrives in URL mode is considered to be a URL, and may be
displayed appropriately.  The "+" and "-" behave as described in 2.1.


2.9 Character Spacing

Specification: <^F> "P" ["P"|"F"] <^F>

The default spacing by an IRC client may be either proportional (each
character uses a varying amount of horizontal space -- like a textbook)
or fixed (each character uses the same amount of horizontal space -- like
a typewriter).  A client may suggest switching to a proportional or fixed
character width by using this attribute.

A spacing of "P" requests proportional width, while a spacing of "F"
requests a fixed width.  If the spacing type is omitted, the client should
revert to its default spacing, which could be either proportional or fixed.


2.10 Encoding

Specification: <^F> "E" [encoding] <^F>

Because IRC was developed in Finland, it has historically used Latin-1 for
encoding text.  Latin-1 (ISO 8859-1) is ASCII, with the upper 128 characters
making up national symbols from several European countries.  Latin-1 is
sufficient for most English speakers and those using a handful of Western
European languages, but cannot be used to send characters from other
languages.

For this purpose, the "E" encoding attribute may be used to change the
default "encoding" of text.  The following encodings are valid:

A number between 1 and 10 may be used to specify the ISO character sets
ISO 8859-1 through ISO 8859-10.  These character sets all use ASCII for
the lower 128 characters.  They span most European and Latin-based langauges,
as well as the Cyrillic, Greek, Arabic, and Hebrew character sets.

An encoding of "U" indicates UTF-8 encoding.  This is a method of encoding
Unicode (16-bit or even 32-bit) characters in an 8-bit character set.  The
lower 128 characters remain ASCII.

All other encodings are reserved for future use.

Specifying no encoding must return the IRC client to the default encoding.
If no user selected default is chosen, it should return to Latin-1
encoding.

Please note that all encodings preserve the lower 128 characters for
ASCII.  Therefore all CTCP control characters remain identical.


2.11 Normal

Specification: <^F> "N" <^F>

In order to facilitate the clearing of all currently set text
attributes, a means of specifying a return to baseline is desired. This
code will clear all attributes and return to displaying text in the client's
currently defined 'normal' attribute set.


2.12 Blinking

Specification: <^F> "K" ["+"|"-"] <^F>

This attribute turns on or off the "blinking" attribute of the current
text.  Blinking is defined as temporarily setting the foreground color
to be the same as the background color, and then setting it back,
usually at a 1/2 second switching frequency.  It is possible that this
attribute may have odd interactions with other attributes, so it may be
handled in an implementation-defined manner.  The "+" and "-" behave as
described in 2.1.


2.13 Extensions

Specification: <^F> "X" [optional-arguments] <^F>

In order to facilitate the extension of this protocol, a client may
indicate such an extension as follows:

Clients are expected to use some sort of identifier following "X" to
prevent conflicts between the attribute extensions of differing
clients.  These "extension attributes" exist only for testing or for
implementing client-specific features.  THEY SHOULD NOT BE CONSIDERED
VALID UNIVERSAL ATTRIBUTES.


2.14 Deprecations

Currently implemented standard codes are ^B for Bold, ^V for Inverse or
Reverse (as in ircII), ^_ for Underline, and ^O to turn off all
attributes.  These are being replaced by the above formatting
specifications, and should no longer be sent by IRC clients, per section
2.  Clients receiving these messages may either strip the codes from the
text or display them as previously defined. 

There are also several competing non-standard format codes, some involving
^C or ^L to change colors, or various other codes to change format modes.
These should be ignored or converted to the CTCP/2 format standard.  We
have intentionally tried to pick a format character (^F) which is currently
not in use by any client for special codes.


2.15 Examples

These examples demonstrate how format codes might be used in a typical
IRC session.  Only the message text is shown, for clarity.  Beneath each
example is a description of the desired formatting.  In these examples,
the sequence "^F" is taken to indicate ASCII code 6 (the format character).

My name is ^FB+^FLinda^FB-^F.

   The text is "My name is Linda."
   The word "Linda" should be displayed in boldface.  The trailing period
   and the preceding text ("My name is ") are displayed in the default
   attributes.

^FC#FFCC33^FKangaroos^FC^F are pretty -- ^FU+^Ffrom a ^FI+^Fdistance^FN^F.

   The text is "Kangaroos are pretty -- from a distance."
   The word "Kangaroos" should appear in RGB color #FFCC33, with the
   background color left unchanged.  The rest of the text should be
   displayed using default colors.  The text "from a distance" should
   be underlined, and the word "distance" should be underlined and in
   italics.  Note that the trailing period is displayed using the
   default attributes.

Please look at my ^FF+^Fhomepage^FF^F: ^FL+^Fhttp://www.xyzzy.zz^FL-^F :)

   The text is "Please look at my homepage: http://www.xyzzy.zz :)"
   The word "homepage" should be displayed in a slightly larger font
   and the text "http://www.xyzzy.zz" should be marked as a URL
   (possibly a "hot link" that a user can use to reach the resource).
