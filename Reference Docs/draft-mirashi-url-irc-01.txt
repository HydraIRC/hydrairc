Abstract

     A new URL scheme "irc:" is defined. The irc URL scheme is used to
     refer to either IRC (Internet Relay Chat) servers or individual 
     entities (channels or people) on IRC servers.


Description

    With the advent of "plugins", and realtime support via CGI and Java,
    web developers have come up with different means to integrate IRC
    support into their products. This document attempts to define a URL
    scheme ("irc:") which would make this process easier.

    An irc URL takes the form:

       irc:[ //[ <host>[:<port>] ]/[<target>] [,needpass] ]

    where,
	
    <host>
      The IRC server host to connect to. See RFC 1034 [Sec 3.5] and 
      RFC 1123 [Sec 2.1] for details on allowed Internet hostname 
      formats. If omitted, the client must connect to a prespecified 
      default IRC server. irc: URL scheme implementors are recommended

Internet Draft             irc: URL scheme              August 29, 1996


      to provide a preconfigured list of IRC servers/networks to choose 
      from, and must have the ability to let the user designate a 
      default IRC server host.

    <port> 
      The port number to connect to. If  :<port> is omitted,  the 
      default IANA assigned IRC port 194 is used. Clients may use port 
      6667 as an alternate port in case connection to the default 
      port fails. Clients should also maintain a default port number,
      as well as associations of port numbers with specific hosts. 

    <target> 
      If a target is referred to, it takes the form:

          <target>       ::= <chtarget> | <nickstring>
          <chtarget>     ::= <chstring> | <keychstring>
          <keychstring>  ::= <chstring> ',needkey' 

      The target can be either an IRC channel or a person on IRC 
      (identified by his/her nickname and other associated information)
      RFC 1459 (sec 2.3) defines an IRC channel as:

           <channel>    ::= ('#' | '&' | '+') <chstring>
           <chstring>   ::= <any 8bit code except SPACE, BELL, NUL,
                                               CR, LF and comma (',')>
     
      In the irc: URL scheme, "unsafe" characters (RFC 1738, Sec 2.2) in 
      <chstring> or <nickstring> must be encoded  by a character triplet
      consisting of the character "%" followed by the two hexadecimal 
      digits (from "0123456789ABCDEF") which form the hexadecimal value
      of the octet. (The characters "abcdef" may also be used in 
      hexadecimal encodings.) 

      Since most IRC channels begin with the '#' character which is 
      unsafe in a URL, it must be encoded. To avoid the cumbersome
      % encoding for most references, this draft omits the specific 
      mention of a channel prefix in a <target> of type <chstring>. 
      irc: URL scheme implementors must maintain a prefix variable (by 
      default, '#', with '&' and '+' as other allowable values) to form
      channel names in accordance with RFC 1459. Further, the characters
      '!', ',', ':' and '@' are reserved in the irc: URL scheme and must
      also be encoded.
     
      [,needkey]
      IRC channels can require a keyword (RFC 1459, Sec 4.2.1) before
      entrance to the channel is granted. This parameter indicates to
      the irc: URL scheme implementor that the user should be prompted
      for the channel key, before an attempt to dereference the URL
      is made. This parameter should be ignored for modeless + channels.

Internet Draft             irc: URL scheme              August 29, 1996


      <nickstring> is described by (also see RFC1459, Sec 2.3):

         <nickstring> ::= <nicktypes> ',isnick'
         <nicktypes>  ::= <nick> | <nickinfo> | <userinfo>
         <nickinfo>   ::= <nick> '!' <user> '@' <hostmask>
         <userinfo>   ::= <user> '@' <servername>
         <nick>       ::= <letter> { <letter> | <number> | <special> }
         <user>       ::= <nonwhite> { <nonwhite> }
         <letter>     ::= 'a' ... 'z' | 'A' ... 'Z'
         <number>     ::= '0' ... '9'
         <special>    ::= '-' | '[' | ']' | '\' | '`' | '^' | '{' | '}'
         <nonwhite>   ::= <any 8bit code except SPACE (0x20), NUL (0x0), 
                                  CR (0xd), and LF (0xa)>
         <servername> ::= <host>
         <hostmask>   ::= <chstring>

      Characters deemed unsafe (RFC 1738, Sec. 2.2) in <nickstring> (and
      thus in <special>) must be encoded as usual. The irc: URL scheme
      implementor may choose to initiate a DCC (direct client to client)
      chat connection to the user when <nickstring> is specified. Many
      IRC clients currently support DCC functionality and a rough draft
      appears at ftp://ftp.undernet.org/irc/docs/technical/DCC.doc. 
      Alternatively, they may choose to stick to exchanging messages 
      via IRC, or offer the user a choice between the two.

     [,needpass]
      IRC servers can require a password (RFC 1459, Sec 7) before a
      connection to the server is granted. This parameter indicates to
      the irc: URL scheme implementor that the user should be prompted
      for the server password, before an attempt to dereference the URL
      is made.


Client issues

      irc: URL scheme implementors must have the following user 
      configurable fields or variables in their clients (also see RFC
      1459):

      * Default IRC server host to connect to (alternate servers if 
        the connection to the default server fails, may also be listed).
        A list of IRC servers/networks to choose from is also suggested
        for inclusion.

      * Default port to connect on (alternate ports if the connection
        to the default port fails may also be listed)

      * Default channelname prefix (usually '#', but can also take the
        values '&' and '+')

Internet Draft             irc: URL scheme              August 29, 1996


      * Default nickname to connect under (alternate nicknames should be
        specified since the specified nickname may already be in use)

      * Real name (also known as the IRCNAME variable) of the person.

      The USER command passed to an IRC server requires a <username> 
      parameter. Since it is easy for a client to lie about its username
      by relying solely on the USER message, the availability of this
      as a user configurable field should be avoided. This field may
      be automatically obtained on Unix systems via the getpwuid() (or
      a similar) system call. On other systems, the identity section of
      mail programs on the system frequently contains a "reply-to" or
      an "e-mail" field, often in a user@host format. The user portion
      of this may be used for the <username> parameter. Only if these 
      methods fail, should the user be prompted for a <username>.

      As discussed earlier, the client must be able to prompt the user
      for a channel key or server password, based on the irc: URL 
      specified. It may also offer the user a choice of a DCC chat
      connection when a nickname is dereferenced.


Examples

    The URL's:

       irc:    irc://      irc:///

    reference the default/local IRC server. The URL:

      irc:///,needpass
 
    references the default IRC server and prompts the user for a 
    password, before connecting to it.

    The URL
          
      irc:///help
  
    references IRC channel help  (this could be #help, &help or +help, 
    depending on the channel prefix set) on the default IRC server.

    The URL 

      irc:///Mmmm!mandar@*uoknor.edu,isnick

    references a person with nickname Mmmm, and user@host matching
    mandar@*uoknor.edu on the default IRC server.

Internet Draft             irc: URL scheme              August 29, 1996


      irc://foobar.org/Mmmm,isnick,needpass

    references a person with nickname Mmmm on server foobar.org.  The 
    connection to foobar.org takes place over the default port, and the 
    user is prompted for a server password.

    The URL
  
      irc://foobar.org:6665/secret,needkey

    references the IRC channel secret on server foobar.org. The
    connection takes place over port 6665, and the user is prompted
    for a channel key in order to reference the channel.  

    
Current Implementations

    Despite the lack of a common URL scheme, many integration efforts
    between IRC and the world  wide web have been successful. These
    can be roughly categorised into:

    IRC plugins:
      These are IRC clients distributed separately and designed to work
      in close conjunction with the browser. Current plugins include:
		http://home.netscape.com/comprod/chat.html
			(Netscape Chat - Netscape Corp)
		http://www.globalchat.com
			(Global Chat - Quarterdeck Corp)
		http://www.ichat.com/client.htm	
			(iChat - iChat Inc)
      They often include proprietary protocol implementations, in 
      addition to IRC support.

    Java gateways:
      These take the form of a Java capable Web browser that interacts
      with an IRC server and  updates "live content" web pages. The
      foll. URL's which illustrate these, were functional at the time of
      writing:
                http://polaris.ibm.com/~gong/irc_room.html
                http://www.blackdown.org/~kbs/irctst/demo.html
                http://irc.webmaster.com
                http://virtual.itribe.net/jirc/
                http://www.dimensionx.com/products/cafe/index.html
                http://www.hdmdigital.com/~cknight/dotcom/zirc/
      These gateways take up resources on the machine hosting the web
      server, and are also slower than IRC clients which open a direct
      connection to the IRC server. A variation of the Java gateway is a
      CGI gateway, which is based on CGI scripts instead of Java, but
      quickly fading from existence due to CGI's limited realtime
      functionality.

Internet Draft             irc: URL scheme              August 29, 1996


    IRC client - Web browser communication:
      Recent IRC clients often communicate with the Web browser via
      mechanisms such as API calls or DDE, and pass back a URL to be
      opened via the browser.  Some of these can also be set up as
      "plugins" or "helper applications". Clients that implement this 
      include:
               http://apollo3.com/~acable/virc.html   (Visual IRC)
               http://www.mirc.co.uk/  (mIRC)
               http://www.bcpl.lib.md.us/~frappa/pirch.html  (Pirch)
               http://www.vapor.com/support/amirc/ (AmIRC)
               http://catless.ncl.ac.uk/Programs/Zircon/ (Zircon)
               http://xirc.bitgate.com/ (XIRC)

    It is anticipated that the irc: URL scheme would allow Web
    browsers to open a local dynamic "live content" page as
    demonstrated by the gateways  (thus eliminating the need to go via a
    gateway).  They  may also choose to open a plugin IRC client. The
    choice is left to the individual irc: URL scheme implementor.


History

    IRC as a protocol first appeared in 1988 and thus predates the world
    wide web by several years. A formal specification of the protocol
    was drawn up in 1993 (RFC 1459). Today, there are thousands of
    simultaneous users on various IRC networks. Integration efforts with
    the World Wide Web continue (as outlined above). The irc: URL
    scheme first appeared in the Rating Services and Rating Systems
    document published by the PICS (Platform for Internet Content
    Selection) technical subcommitee of the World Wide Web
    Consortium:
              http://www.w3.org/pub/WWW/PICS/services.html
    However, the original definition lacked RFC 1459 conformance. This
    draft attempts to add RFC 1459 conformance to the scheme, besides
    other features previously lacking.


Security Considerations

    Security issues  are tackled in RFC 1738 and RFC 1459. Character
    encoding rules must be followed for unsafe and reserved characters.
    Clients should take care that attempts to connect to ports other
    than 194 in the well known port range 1-1024, are disregarded. IRC
    servers often use the non-registered port 6667 (or ports in the 
    range 6000-7000) for clients to connect to. Since the URL 
    dereference would always result in client to server messages 
    prefixed by NICK, or USER, or JOIN or MSG, chances of a dangerous 
    URL resolution are minimized. 

    Nicknames on IRC are not constant - different people may use the

Internet Draft             irc: URL scheme              August 29, 1996


    same nickname at different times (although not simultaneously on
    the same IRC server or network). This feature/anomaly is inherent
    to the definition of the current IRC protocol (RFC 1459). It is
    highly recommended that irc: URL scheme implementors warn the
    user when dereferencing a <nick> instead of <nickinfo>. A WHOIS
    IRC lookup is also suggested.


Scheme summary

    The irc: URL scheme is unique in its own way. It does borrow 
    concepts from other URL schemes (RFC 1738) however. Like the nntp:
    URL scheme, it allows the specification of a <host> for a unique
    resource location. However, many IRC servers often limit 
    connections from outside domains. Thus, like the news: and mailto:
    URL schemes, it allows for the resolution of this information at
    the client level, and like the file: URL scheme, allows <host>
    to be an empty string. Like the telnet: URL scheme, it does not
    designate a data object, but rather an interactive service.
 
    The draft defines the irc: URL scheme and "must be configured" 
    fields. This scheme is extremely useful given the shortcomings of
    current implementations. There's only one operation defined on this 
    UR*, and it is not very GET like (the IRC protocol is outlined in 
    RFC 1459).  It can be proxied into HTTP/HTML, but this does have
    severe limitations as mentioned earlier. Security considerations 
    have been outlined. It does not follow the relative URL (RFC 1808)
    model.
