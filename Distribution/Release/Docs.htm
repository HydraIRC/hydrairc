    <P>Due to popular demand I've added a *temporary* solution to the autoconnect<br>
      and autologin stuff that has been requested.<br>
      <br>
      Please read this bit carefully!<br>
      <br>
      HydraIRC will execute a command profile called "OnStartup" when it starts also, 
      when HydraIRC connects to a server it tries to match up the server to a server 
      in the server list, if it then finds a matching server name it then determines 
      the network that the server belongs to. Once the network has been determined 
      HydraIRC will then execute the command profile called 
      "&lt;Network&gt;_OnLoggedIn" when you are logged in to the server, then it will 
      execute one called "&lt;ServerName&gt;_OnLoggedIn". Additionally, HydraIRC will 
      run command profiles called "&lt;Network&gt;_&lt;Channel&gt;_OnJoin" when you 
      join a channel.<br>
      <br>
      Example command profile names and contents.<br>

      Note: this is a temporary solution, at a later date you will be able to<br>
      assign command profiles to networks and select which networks to connect to<br>
      when the application starts, but this will do for now.</P>
    <P>Noobie note:&nbsp; your server name must appear somewhere in the&nbsp;connect 
      dialog box's server and network list for &lt;Network&gt;_OnLoggedIn to work 
      and&nbsp;the network names must match!<br>
      &nbsp;</P>
    <p><b><font size="4"><a name="Nick Change Processing">Nick Change Processing</a></font></b></p>
    <P>HydraIRC lets you configure not 1, not 2 but as many alternate nicks as you 
      like, to guarantee that you'll get connected to the server.</P>
    <P>You can use the Tools/Options/Identities dialog to change your user 
      identities,&nbsp; user identities must have a list of nicks associated with 
      them.</P>
    <P>When you first connect to a server HydraIRC will use the first nick in the 
      chosen identity's list of nicks, if that is taken then it will try the next one 
      in the list and so on.&nbsp; If it's still not found an unused nick then 
      HydraIRC will add a numerical prefix to your preferred nick (in square 
      brackets) and will keep incrementing the number until a free nick is 
      found.&nbsp; If you get disconnected for any reason (ping timeout, etc..) then 
      HydraIRC will then reconnect using the nick you were last using.&nbsp; If that 
      is taken then HydraIRC will restart the process of nick selection again.&nbsp; 
      It performs this procedure for every subsequent re-connect attempt.</P>
    <P>Example:</P>
    <P>You have 2 nicks, "MyName" and "My_Name".</P>
    <P>Upon connection for the first time it will try and use "MyName", but that nick 
      was in-use so HydraIRC tried "My_Name" instead and connects ok.&nbsp; For some 
      reason you get disconnected, so HydraIRC reconnects and uses the last nick 
      used, which in this example was "My_Name", but that nick is still taken because 
      the server hasn't figured out that you've timed out yet.&nbsp; So HydraIRC 
      tries "MyName" again, but that's still taken, so it then tries "My_Name" again 
      (because it's second in the list), but this is still in use, so then HydraIRC 
      tries to connect with "[1]MyName" and connects successfully.&nbsp; If you were 
      to get disconnected again, then HydraIRC would try "[1]MyName" again (because 
      that's what it was using last), then "MyName", "My_Name", "[1]MyName", 
      "[2]MyName", "[3]MyName" and so on...</P>
    <P>Now just how cool is that? :)</P>
    <P>Note: in contrast most clients always re-connect with your first nick, then 
      your alternate nick and then stop.&nbsp; This can be really annoying if you had 
      queued up a file on an fserve that sends the file to the nick of the user that 
      queued it.&nbsp; If you changed your nick and then queued a file, then your 
      client reconnected using a different nick you would not be sent the file.&nbsp; 
      In addition most clients don't allow you to specify nicks on a per 
      server/network basis, and some even do, but then forget them and just use the 
      last used nick when reconnecting to a server, even on on a different network! 
      (Trillian for example..)</P>
    <P>Again, as you can see HydraIRC kicks ass.</P>
    <P>Note: future releases will also try and obtain your preferred nick (or last 
      used nick) after a re-connect with a temporary alternate nick.</P>
    <P><b><font size="4"> <a name="DCC sending when behind a router/firewall">DCC sending 
            when behind a router/firewall</a></font></b></P>
    <p>When connecting to an IRC server, HydraIRC will look at the welcome message 
      and extract the DNS/Host information from the message (if present).
    </p>
    <p>Also, if you do a /whois on yourself and the server supports the 338 or 378 
      numeric replies, the host information will be extracted from the reply.</p>
    <p>The extracted string will then be used for DCC sending unless you set a value 
      for "Router Address" in the prefs, thus giving you the option of being able to 
      override the address that HydraIRC uses.</p>
    <p>The extracted string or Router Address setting is passed to other users when 
      you initialise a DCC SEND (not receive) so they know what IP/Port to connect 
      to.</p>
    <p>If you are behind a firewall and your machine is NOT the firewall AND you only 
      connect to servers from which HydraIRC cannot determine your external address 
      (e.g. a local server on your lan) AND you need to SEND files to people OUTSIDE 
      your LAN then you should specify the EXTERNAL ip address of your router and 
      configure it to forward the usual dcc ports to your machine's LAN 
      address.&nbsp; ;)&nbsp; (Read that twice)</p>
    <p>Basically, set the Router Address option in prefs if you have problems, leave 
      it blank otherwise.</p>
    <p></p>
    <p>You still need to configure your router/firewall so that it forwards the ports 
      to your machines correctly however.</p>
    <p>e.g.</p>
    <p>Router: 192.168.0.1, Internet Address: 62.1.23.45<br>
      PC1: 192.168.0.2<br>
      PC2: 192.168.0.3</p>
    <p></p>
    <p>On PC1, you would use dcc ports 3072-3171<br>
      On PC2, you would use dcc ports 3172-3271
    </p>
    <p></p>
    <p>On the router you configure port forwarding so that it forwards incoming tcp 
      packets bound for ports 3072-3171 to 192.168.0.1 (PC1) and then configure it to 
      forward incoming tcp packets bound for ports 3172-3271 to 192.168.0.2 (PC2)</p>
    <p></p>
    <p>Then any packets heading to 62.1.23.45:3072-3171 are forwarded to PC1 and any 
      packets heading to 62.1.23.45:3172-3271 are forwarded to PC2.</p>
    <p></p>
    <p>In HydraIRC you would need to set the "Router Address" option to "62.1.23.45" 
      (or you can use the FQDN of the Router's external interface if you like. e.g 
      "host1343.location.isp.co.uk")</p>
    <p></p>
    <p>You can use the options "DCC Send First Port" and "DCC Send Last Port" in 
      HydraIRC to configure the port ranges for the PC's</p>
    <p></p>
    <p>e.g.</p>
    <p>on PC1 you would set "DCC Send First Port" to "3072" and "DCC Send Last Port" 
      to "3171"<br>
      on PC2 you would set "DCC Send First Port" to "3172" and "DCC Send Last Port" 
      to "3271"</p>
    <P><b><font size="4"><a name="Colors and styles">Colors and styles</a></font></b></P>
    <P>"Ctrl+K&lt;fgcolor&gt;[,&lt;bgcolor&gt;]text" - sets foreground (text) color, 
      and optionally sets background color</P>
    <P>So, "Ctrl+K8,7yellow on orange" would be displayed&nbsp;as "<span style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: #ff6600"><font color="#ffff00">yellow 
          on orange</font></span>"</P>
    <P>"Ctrl+M&lt;fg-hi-color&gt;[&lt;bg-hi-color&gt;]text" - sets forground (text) 
      color, and optionally sets background color, using hex 8bpp RGB color 
      values.&nbsp; e.g. white = 0xFFFFFF, red = 0xFF0000, green = 
      0x00ff00,&nbsp;blue = 0x0000FF.&nbsp; So yellow on orange would be: 
      "Ctrl+MFFFF00,FF7F00yellow on orange".</P>
    <P>Note: This method, of color changing is not supported by many clients and 
      takes up (max) 14 characters to change the fg and bg colors, the IRC 
      protocol&nbsp;has a limit of max 512 characters per line, channel line limits 
      will be less. For this reason it is not advisable to change color using this 
      method two many times on one line, if the data is being sent via the 
      server,&nbsp; if it's just for a local echo, you've got no worries.&nbsp; 
      Bersirc supports this mode, not sure about other clients yet.</P>
    <P>The advantage is that the color will always be displayed the same on any 
      client that supports it.&nbsp; User's can remap the normal 16 colors to be 
      different colors.&nbsp; e.g. 8 = yellow, but it might not be displayed as 
      yellow, or it might be a slightly different shade of yellow.</P>
    <P>To work out these values, use a color picker in any decent paint program and 
      convert the HTML color value to decimal using a calculator (calc.exe for 
      instance).</P>
    <P>Ctrl+R&nbsp; - Reverses background and forground colors.</P>
    <P>Ctrl+U - Toggle underline</P>
    <P>Ctrl+B - Toggle bold</P>
    <P>Ctrl+N - Toggle Italic</P>
    <P>Ctrl+O - Reset to normal background and foreground colors.&nbsp; So, if your 
      normal background is black, and your normal text is white, then this sequence 
      "normalCtrl+Knormal" would appear as "<span style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: #000000"><font color="#ffffff">normalnormal</font></span>".&nbsp; 
      If however you have the much nicer looking defaults of black text on a white 
      background, the sequence would appear as "normalnormal".</P>
    <P>Some clients do not handle Ctrl+O correctly and reset the colors to white text 
      on a black background, rather than using your normal colors.&nbsp; So, some 
      clients would display the sequence above as "normal<span style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: #000000"><font color="#ffffff">normal</font></span>" 
      which is incorrect.</P>
    <P>mIRC does not handle italics.</P>
    <P>The sequence "normalCtrl+BCtrl+UCtrl+Nbold italic underlineCtrl+Bitalic 
      underlineCtrl+NCtrl+Bbold underlineCtrl+UCtrl+Nitalic 
      boldCtrl+NboldCtrl+BCtrl+NitalicCtrl+NCtrl+UunderlineCtrl+Unormal" should 
      appear as "normal<u><i><b>bold italic underline</b>italic underline</i><b>bold 
          underline</b></u><b><i>italic bold</i>bold</b><i>italic</i><u>underline</u>normal"</P>
    <P>"Ctrl+K8,7yellow on orangeCtrl+Rorange on yellow" = "<span style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: #ff6600"><font color="#ffff00">yellow 
          on orange</font></span><span style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: #ffff00"><font color="#ff6600">orange 
          on yellow</font></span>"</P>
    <P>Note: mIRC does not handle ctrl+r correctly, the same text would appear as "<span style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: #ff6600"><font color="#ffff00">yellow 
          on orange</font></span><span style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: #000000"><font color="#ffffff">orange 
          on yellow</font></span>"&nbsp; Yes, it's offical, mirc sucks ass.</P>
    <P>Note: Bersirc does not handle ctrl+r correctly either, this control string 
      "normalCtrl+RreverseCtrl+K8yellow on black" appears like this: "normal<font color="#ffffff"><span style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: #000000">reverse</span><span style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: #ffff00">yellow 
on black</span></font>",&nbsp; Yes, it's offical, Bersirc sucks too, but not as much 
      is mIRC.</P>
    <P>HydraIRC handles it correctly: "normal<font color="#ffffff"><span style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: #000000">reverse</span></font><span style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: #000000"><font color="#ffff00">yellow 
          on black</font></span>" (if your normal text colors were black on white, or 
      "<span style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: #000000"><font color="#ffffff">normal</font></span>reverse<font color="#ffff00">yellow 
        on black</font>" if your normal colors were white on black, note that this 
      shows up why you must set text and background colors.&nbsp; If you want white 
      or black to appear as white or back on ALL clients, regardless of their default 
      colors.&nbsp; you would use this: 
      "Ctrl+K1,0normalCtrl+K0,1reverseCtrl+K8,1yellow on black"</P>
    <P>The use of Ctrl+R should be avoided as it's interpretation is flawed on most 
      clients.</P>
    <P>There is also another issue with some clients because the idiot who though up 
      the color code numbers didn't think about their parse routines.&nbsp; Most 
      clients can't display "<font color="#ff0000">10</font>" and end up displaying 
      "0" instead, what you say ?&nbsp; Yeah, I know, crap huh..&nbsp; "Why?" you 
      ask.. Well, if you remember that "Ctrl+K410" is the correct sequence, most 
      clients try and interpret "41" as the color number, which of course is not a 
      valid color number, so they ignore the "Ctrl+K" and the bad number and then 
      just display the "0". /me *Sighs*</P>
    <P>If you want to display a number directly after a color change on all clients, 
      tough luck, you'll have to add a space. e.g. "Ctrl+K4 10" which appears as " <font color="#ff0000">
        10</font>".&nbsp;
    </P>
    <P>HydraIRC of course figures out that 41 isn't a valid color number, and then 
      think, oh, but 4 is.. And then displays the correct output.&nbsp; HydraIRC also 
      supports 2 digit color numbers that have a leading 0,&nbsp; e.g.&nbsp; 
      "Ctrl+K04,0510" displays "<span style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: #800000"><font color="#ff0000">10</font></span>"</P>
    <p>Here are the correct color definitions</p>
    <p>0 - <font color="#ffffff">white(white)<br>
      </font>1 - black<br>
      2 - <font color="#000080">darkblue<br>
      </font>3 - <font color="#008000">darkgreen<br>
      </font>4 - <font color="#ff0000">red<br>
      </font>5 - <font color="#800000">brown<br>
      </font>6 - <font color="#800080">purple<br>
      </font>7 - <font color="#ff6600">orange<br>
      </font>8 - <font color="#ffff00">yellow<br>
      </font>9 - <font color="#00ff00">green<br>
      </font>10 - <font color="#0099cc">darkcyan<br>
      </font>11 - <font color="#00ffff">cyan<br>
      </font>12 - <font color="#0000ff">blue<br>
      </font>13 - <font color="#ff00ff">pink<br>
      </font>14 - <font color="#808080">gray<br>
      </font>15 - <font color="#c0c0c0">lightgray</font></p>
    <p>As you can see, HydraIRC is great when it comes to having a well-defined 
      output.</p>
    <P><b><font size="4"><a name="Theme Creation Notes">Theme Creation Notes</a></font></b></P>
    <P>These are just some basic notes cut and pasted from various conversations with 
      people, etc.&nbsp; The should prove useful to anyone who wants to make their 
      own theme though.</P>
    <p>Themes are stored in Theme Collection files and you can store more than one 
      theme per file (XML is great!)
    </p>
    <p></p>
    <p>See the included themes\default.xml for an example file.
    </p>
    <p></p>
    <p>You can change themes for EACH AND ANY WINDOW whenever you like by using the 
      /set command in the window like this:
    </p>
    <p></p>
    <p>/set theme=&lt;nameoftheme&gt;
    </p>
    <p></p>
    <p>where &lt;nameoftheme&gt; is the same as the name property of a theme node in 
      any theme file in the themes directory.
    </p>
    <p></p>
    <p>The themes\default.xml file currently contains two themes, these are called 
      "Basic" and "Alternate".
    </p>
    <p></p>
    <p>So, if you used the command:
    </p>
    <p></p>
    <p>/set theme=alternate
    </p>
    <p></p>
    <p>HydraIRC would scan all *.xml files in Themes\ and will load the theme if it 
      finds it.
    </p>
    <p></p>
    <p>HydraIRC has a built-in theme called "Default", HydraIRC will use the build-in 
      theme if for any reason it cannot load the theme that was specified.
    </p>
    <p></p>
    <p>HydraIRC 0.336 and before used the "Basic" theme, HydraIRC 0.337 used the 
      "Alternate" theme by default.
    </p>
    <p>HydraIRC 0.338 now has a new preference that allow you to select the default 
      theme for new windows. See "Misc/Default Theme". in prefs.
    </p>
    <p></p>
    <p>This can also be set with the command:
    </p>
    <p></p>
    <p>/set misc/default theme=&lt;nameoftheme&gt;
    </p>
    <p></p>
    <p>Note that XML requires that &lt;'s &gt;'s and &amp;'s are escaped along with 
      the color/reverse/bold/normal/italic change codes, otherwise the XML file 
      cannot be parsed correctly - This is why you can see lots of \003's, \074's and 
      \076's in the themes which are the escaped octal representations of the ASCII 
      values.
    </p>
    <p>To get a '\' character you have to use '\\' or '\134'.
    </p>
    <p></p>
    <p>For a list of ASCII characters and their octal values see here
    </p>
    <p><a href="http://www.asciitable.com/"> http://www.asciitable.com/</a></p>
    <p></p>
    <p>The supported style/codes are:
    </p>
    <p></p>
    <p>'\002' bold
      <br>
      '\003' color change '\003&lt;2 digit decimal foreground&gt;[,&lt;2 digit 
      decimal background&gt;]'
      <br>
      '\004' hi-color change '\004&lt;6 digit hex foreground&gt;[,&lt;6 digit hex 
      background&gt;]'
      <br>
      '\037' underline
      <br>
      '\035' italics
      <br>
      '\026' reverse foreground and background colors.
      <br>
      '\017' set normal forground and background colors. (per line basis in HydraIRC)
      <br>
      '\006', '\022' and '\023' are stripped from the output
    </p>
    <p></p>
    <p>it's probably not a good idea to use linefeeds and carriage returns (these 
      will probably be stripped at a later date)</p>
    <p></p>
    <p><u>Important Notes for theme designers: </u>
    </p>
    <p>When a theme is loaded it is kept in memory and reused by all other windows 
      that use the same theme.
    </p>
    <p>When HydraIRC is told to use a particular theme it first looks to see if it is 
      loaded and if it is then HydraIRC does NOT reload it from disk. So if you want 
      to see changes to a theme you must first make sure no windows are using the 
      theme you're trying to load. This can be done by issuing a "/set theme=default" 
      in each open window.
    </p>
    <p>An example theme line looks like this:</p>
    <P>&lt;item appliesto="SCQD" itemid="10002" formatstring="-\074NICK\076- 
      \074ALL\076"/&gt;</P>
    <P>The unescaped string looks like this:</P>
    <P>-&lt;NICK&gt;- &lt;ALL&gt;</P>
    <P>The output might look like this:</P>
    <P>-echbot- Game ready to start in #ctfpickup.euro</P>
    <P>Search HydraIRCTypes.h for #define RPLS_NOTICE_CONNECT and look at irc.h for 
      the itemid's<br>
      applied to can be a combination of any of the following characters: SCQD which 
      mean<br>
      Server, Channel, Query and DCC Chat respectively.</P>
    <P>In the example above, 10002 relates to RPLS_NOTICE, and "SCQD" means this if 
      for ALL windows, &lt;NICK&gt; is replaced with the nick of the person sending 
      the message, &lt;ALL&gt; is replaced with the notice message that was sent.</P>
    <P>Hydra_; if you want to see which variables you can use for each itemid<br>
      Hydra_; you can search server.cpp for the itemid<br>
      `-Anders; allright<br>
      Hydra_; and then look at the code just before OutputFormatterLines()<br>
      Hydra_; OutputFormatter() lines..<br>
      Hydra_; 1 sec, i'll give you an example<br>
      `-Anders; mkay<br>
      Hydra_; m_Variables[VID_NICK] = a;<br>
      Hydra_; m_Variables[VID_USERNAME] = b;<br>
      Hydra_; m_Variables[VID_HOST] = c;<br>
      Hydra_; m_Variables[VID_NAME] = d;<br>
      Hydra_; OutputFormatter(BIC_NOTICE,RPL_WHOISUSER);<br>
      Hydra_; so you can see for the SERVER -&gt; RPL_WHOISUSER you can use NICK, 
      USERNAME, HOST and NAME<br>
      `-Anders; pretty straight forward<br>
      Hydra_; also....<br>
      Hydra_; if you look at this:<br>
      Hydra_; void IRCServer::InitVariables( void )<br>
      Hydra_; you'll see this:<br>
      Hydra_; m_Variables[VID_MYNICK] = m_Nick;<br>
      Hydra_; m_Variables[VID_MYHOST] = "localhost"; // TODO: change<br>
      Hydra_; m_Variables[VID_SERVER] = m_pDetails-&gt;m_Name;<br>
      Hydra_; m_Variables[VID_SERVERDESCRIPTION] = m_pDetails-&gt;m_Description;<br>
      Hydra_; m_Variables[VID_RESPONSE] = m_CurrentResponse;<br>
      Hydra_; which can be used in all strings<br>
      Hydra_; but RESPONSE is a weird one<br>
      Hydra_; as you can't ALWAYS use it...<br>
      Hydra_; e.g. you channel text that YOU type in..<br>
      Hydra_; e.g. for channel text that YOU type in..<br>
      Hydra_; as HydraIRC sends it to the server and displays it itself<br>
      Hydra_; and the IRC server doesn't send a response<br>
      Hydra_; also, &lt;ALL&gt; doesn't actually mean &lt;ALL&gt; it just means, the 
      rest of the text that wasn't already put into variables</P>
    <P>you can embed timestamps into themes using &lt;TIMESTAMP=timestamp format&gt;, 
      but turning off timestamps will not remove them from the theme (maybe later..)</P>
    <P>Here's a useful link:</P>
    <P>
      <a href="http://www.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/7908799/xsh/strftime.html">http://www.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/7908799/xsh/strftime.html</a></P>
    <P>An example timestamp usage might be "&lt;TIMESTAMP=[%Hh%Mm]&gt;" which would 
      result in the following output string "[6h30m]" if it was 6:30pm.&nbsp; If you 
      wanted different parts to be in different colors, then do it like this:</P>
    <P>
      "Ctrl+B[Ctrl+BCtrl+k5&lt;TIMESTAMP=%H&gt;Ctrl+k4hCtrl+k5&lt;TIMESTAMP=%M&gt;Ctrl+K4mCtrl+OCtrl+B]Ctrl+B"</P>
    <P>which would look like this:</P>
    <P>"<b>[</b><font color="#ff0000">6</font><font color="#800000">h</font><font color="#ff0000">30</font><font color="#800000">m</font><b>]</b>"</P>

    <P>Notes:</P>
    <P>* Clean out your plugins/folder before running new versions.</P>
    <P>* If HydraIRC crashes on startup then either log off and back on again, or 
      restart your computer.</P>
    <P>* Delete "HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\HydraProductions\HydraIRC\WindowStates" 
      from the registry if HydraIRC crashes at startup.

      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Without BoxedIRC HydraIRC probably wouldn't exist, it gave

      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The output from early versions of HydraIRC was based on BoxedIRC's output.</P>
    <P><EM>Damian Hodgkiss</EM> author of OpenIRC (GPL)<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The author of BoxedIRC used some source from OpenIRC, so I 
      guess Damian deserves a mention here too.</P>
    <P><EM>Jacek Sieka</EM> author of DirectConnect++ (DC++, GPL)<br>
